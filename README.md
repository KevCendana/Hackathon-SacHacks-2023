# SacHacks 2023: LyricLink
- LyricLink is a full stack application using Django, React, HTML & CSS.
- It acts as a forum that sorts through the top 100 songs on Billboard. Users can leave thoughts and comments on the songs. 

### My Personal Experience
I went into this Hackathon with 3 other teammates. We all decided to use a tech stack we were largely unfamiliar with, as we wanted to make this a learning experience. I was in charge of all of the frontend code as well as linking the frontend and backend together. 

Designing the website was fun for me as always. I learned to get familiar with React which I barely had any exposure to. The real challenge was linking it to the backend - the tech stack wasn't just new to me, but I also had to familiarize myself with all the backend code that my teammates wrote. I ended up spending *a lot* of time understanding the code and debugging. I ended up waking up early, coding all day, and sleeping really late.

Overall, I had a great time! Especially since my teammates were all very kind and bright people that were very easy to work with. The website turned out really pretty, and it was very satisfying seeing the Spotify API put in action as it showed all the songs that were updated in real time.

**We only had 24 hours to learn everything, so I'm taking more time to polish it some more. I like seeing finished products and it's been a fun one to program, so I'll continuously make updates until I feel like it's satisfying.**

### How To Run
1. Extract ZIP file
2. Open any terminal 
3. Change Directories into the Frontend folder
4. Type 'npm start'. You should now see the website :)
5. To link with backend, change directories into the Backend folder, and type 'python manage.py runserver'
